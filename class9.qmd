## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("here")
library(tidyverse)

here::i_am("analysis/myanalysis.qmd")
library(here)


df <- read_csv(here("data/levinson_2007_particles.csv"))
```
